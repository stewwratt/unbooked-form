## 1. General Principles
- All changes must preserve the existing form logic, question flow, and Airtable integration.
- The form must remain fully responsive and mobile-friendly.
- All new visual styles should be implemented using minimal CSS modules (no Tailwind).
- Component structure should remain unchanged unless a layout change is essential for the new design or lead magnet integration.

## 2. Visual Design Rules
- The form container must appear as a raised, levelled block of white concrete (embossed slab).
- Use a subtle, pebbled, architectural minimalism texture for the form's background.
- The Unbooked logo must be black and appear sunken/embossed into the top-left of the form panel (use CSS for embossing, not drop shadows).
- The outer background (behind the form and video) should be clean white or subtly textured, never cluttered.
- No drop shadows or glows; all depth must be achieved through embossing, layering, and contrast.
- All text and UI elements must maintain high contrast and accessibility on the new surface.

## 3. Lead Magnet Integration Rules
- Integrate the Lead Magnet Wizard as a multi-step flow, either as:
  - A new entry point before the main form, or
  - An optional step within the existing form (to be decided during planning).
- The Lead Magnet Wizard must:
  - Collect full name, email, and phone before showing results.
  - Submit this info to the backend (adapt /api/lead logic as needed).
  - Calculate and display personalized revenue uplift using the provided formulas.
  - Use sliders for price increase and retention steps.
  - Predict retention using the provided heuristic, but allow user adjustment.
  - Show a progress bar and actionable tips.
  - End with a strong CTA.
- The Lead Magnet Wizard's UI must match the new "embossed concrete" style.

## 4. Submission & Integration
- After the Lead Magnet flow, ensure the main form submission still posts to Airtable via the Cloudflare Worker API.
- All data collected in the Lead Magnet step must be available for later steps or submission as needed.
- Progressive data submission is implemented - data is posted after each key step to prevent data loss.

## 5. Security Rules
- NO console.log or console.error statements in production code.
- All API endpoints must use HTTPS.
- Implement proper error tracking instead of console logging.
- Validate all user inputs on both client and server side.
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration.
- Implement rate limiting on API endpoints.
- Sanitize all user inputs before database storage.

## 6. Footer Requirements
- Fixed position footer at bottom of page.
- Copyright on left, attribution on right.
- Links to personal website (www.joshluakestewart.com).
- Subtle styling that doesn't interfere with main content.

## 7. Ongoing Rule Maintenance
- As new requirements or design prompts are introduced, append new rules to this file.
- Each rule must be clear, actionable, and reference the relevant component or feature.

## 8. Verification
- After any visual or functional overhaul, verify:
  - The form is visually consistent with the new design brief.
  - All steps and submission flows work as before.
  - The Lead Magnet functionality is fully integrated and operational.
  - No regressions in responsiveness or accessibility.
  - No security vulnerabilities or console logging in production.
